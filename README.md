# Relation Extraction
Relation prediction, the task of identifying and classifying relationships between entities in text, plays a crucial role in natural language processing applications such as information extraction, question answering, and knowledge graph construction. In this study, we present a BERT-based model for relation extraction, leveraging the power of contextual language representation to classify relations between entities. Our findings provide insights into the effectiveness of BERT-based models for relation prediction tasks and inform future research in the field.
